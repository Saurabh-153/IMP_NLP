Topic modeling and word embedding are two import fields of natural language processing. Topic model is a type of statistical model that extracts abstract topics from the corpus. Through topic modeling, we can discover hidden semantic structures in the text body. LSA use the matrix decomposition to grab the topics. pLSA and LDA are based on probabilistic model. Word embedding is used to grab features from text data. This techniques map words, sentence to vectors and numbers.
